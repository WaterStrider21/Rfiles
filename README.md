R Practice Files from the Google Data Analytics course
This file displays the palmerpenguins data from Rstudio.
Using tidyverse and ggplot2, we view the dataset and 
create a visualization of the correlation between flipper length and body mass across penguin species.
The project was created with Coursera and Google's tutorials.
